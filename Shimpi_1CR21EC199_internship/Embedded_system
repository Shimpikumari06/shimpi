Title:- Embedded system programming using tinkercad

Definition of Embedded system - 
Basic definition is it is a combo of Hardware(HW) and software(SW) that is defined to do some specific task.
Embedded systems, also known as embedded computers, are small-form-factor computers that power specific tasks. 
They may function as standalone devices or as part of larger systems, hence the term "embedded," and are often used in applications with size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) constraints.

Like most computers, embedded systems are a combination of hardware and software, usually:

Microprocessors or microcontrollers
Graphics processing units (GPUs)
Volatile and non-volatile memory
Input/output communication interfaces and ports
System and application code
Power supplies

Tool Usage :- Tinkercad
Tinkercad is a free-of-charge, online 3D modeling program that runs in a web browser.
Since it became available in 2011 it has become a popular platform for creating models for 3D printing 
as well as an entry-level introduction to constructive solid geometry in schools. It is also used to create a small embedded circuit.
